# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
lst=[5, 10, 20]
try:
    print(lst[5])
except:
    msg="You're out of list range"
    print(msg)

## Output

<img width="599" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9ab9d3-eff4-42ff-8c80-a7434f6e82b7" />

## Result
Thus, the program executed successfully.
