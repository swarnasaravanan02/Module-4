# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
import math

class cse:

    def mech(self, r):
    
        a = (math.pi * pow(r,2))
        
        print("Area of circle: {:.2f}".format(a))
        
r = float(input())

n = cse()

n.mech(r)

## Output

## Result
Thus, the python program is excecuted successfully.
